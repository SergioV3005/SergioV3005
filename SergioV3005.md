### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Sergio Verga** – a Data Science Master's student (and undergraduate researcher) with a background in Physics (Microelectronics). I'm currently working on my thesis in **Reinforcement Learning for Robotics** at the University of Milano-Bicocca and doing undergraduate research at the [Intelligent Sensing Lab (ISLab)](https://islab.disco.unimib.it/).

My main interests include:
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning** & Robotics  
- 🧠 **Deep Learning**  
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing**

I'm passionate about bridging cutting-edge AI techniques with real-world applications, especially in automation, robotics, and intelligent systems.
