### About Me

Hi, I’m **Sergio Verga** – a Data Science Master's student (and external research collaborator) with a background in Physics (Microelectronics). I'm currently working on my thesis in **Reinforcement Learning for Robotics** at the University of Milano-Bicocca and doing research at the [Intelligent Sensing Lab (ISLab)](https://islab.disco.unimib.it/). My main interests include: **Reinforcement Learning** (& Robotics), **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. I'm passionate about bridging cutting-edge AI techniques with real-world applications, especially in automation, robotics, and intelligent systems. Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-verga-5b071b2b6) or check out some of my work below!

### Some projects

- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models for Robotics**  
  Research on multimodal agents for robotic operations (e.g., pick-and-place of objects respecting particular features specified in the prompt). The tasks are studied using the Hugging Face [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) framework (part of my Master's thesis and research). *[Currently private repositories]*

- **Semantic Segmentation on CamVid Dataset**  
  Deep learning pipeline for pixel-wise semantic segmentation using a NN from scratch (U-Net inspired), which has been optimized and compared to two models adapted via transfer learning (MobileNetV2 and DeepLab). [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hiamrob/camvid-semantic-segmentation)

- **Reinforcement Learning Snake Game**  
  Simple RL agent trained to play the classic Snake game with Q-learning.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SergioV3005/snake-reinforcement-learning)

- **Automatic KPI Interpretation with KNIME + GenAI**  
  A KNIME solution for interpreting business KPI reports using workflows integrated with generative AI.
